## Exploring method 1 of 3: Principal component analysis 

<p>In this project, I chose to manually implement PCA through SVD (singular value decomposition) instead of using the built in PCA function in Matlab, which uses eigenvalue decomposition, because this was the method I studied, not for any particular efficiency reasons. The **faultdetection_PCA** file is the main file, including all the histograms, confusion matrices, and threshold line graphs, and the other files are the functions used in the main file. All of them are required for the main file to run.

<p>**DISCLAIMER: !!!** This was just a course project done on a limited time frame, with a very introductory level of knowledge for big data and classification methods, please don't roast me!!
