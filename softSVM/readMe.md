## Exploring method 3 of 3: soft margin support vector machine

In this segment, I use soft-SVM as opposed to hard, due to its far superior performance. There are no other function files in this segment, and should run just fine as a standalone. However, do be wary that this file takes EXTREMELY long to run (up to 10 minutes on a bad computer like my own). This is because a lot of the loops and arrays are not optimized, so a lot of the arrays have changing sizes for each iteration which makes it super expensive to compute, for which I sincerely apologize for.


**DISCLAIMER: !!!** This was just a course project done on a limited time frame, with a very introductory level of knowledge for big data and classification methods, please don't roast me!!
