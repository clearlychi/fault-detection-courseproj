## Exploring method 2 of 3: K-means based clustering

In this segment, I choose k-means clustering out of the many available methods of performing this strategy, not for any particular reason. The **faultdetection_kmeans** file is the main file, including all the histograms, confusion matrices, and threshold line graphs, and the other files are the functions used in the main file. All of them are required for the main file to run. 


**DISCLAIMER: !!!** This was just a course project done on a limited time frame, with a very introductory level of knowledge for big data and classification methods, please don't roast me!!
